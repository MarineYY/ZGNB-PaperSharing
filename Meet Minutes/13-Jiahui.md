## Insights


`Q1`: *What problem does the paper attempt to solve?*

`A1`: This paper attempts to address the issue of the lack of a unified standard for existing AI based attack tree generators, which makes it difficult to apply them across systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for designing attack trees based on existing well-known frameworks

`Q2` *Is this a new problem?*

`A2`: Using classical programming to automatically generate attack trees is not a new problem, as *[H. E. Shrobe](#1--h-e-shrobe-computational-vulnerability-analysis-for-information-survivability-ai-mag-vol-23-no-4-pp-81–94-2002)* have already proposed methods for this purpose. But a standard methodology for designing attack trees had not yet been proposed at that time

`Q5` *What is key to the solution proposed in the paper?*

`A5`: The key to this article is that, based on the proposed methodology, the attack tree is divided into four layers from a high-level structure, corresponding to when, where, what, and how. Each layer uses a well-known framework in the industry, and through this design, the design pattern of the attack tree is unified.

`Q6` *How is the experiment in the paper designed?*

`A6`: The experimental design of this article is to compare the differences between attack trees using this methodology and manually generated attack trees by experts. The biggest difference is that manually generated attack trees by experts are very time-consuming and do not have a unified standard, which changes with the semantic habits of different experts.
