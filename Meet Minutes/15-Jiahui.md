## Insights


`Q1`: *What problem does the paper attempt to solve?*

`A1`: This paper attempts to address the issue of Sigma syntax based SIEM systems, which are widely used in enterprise networks, being easily bypassed by attackers. Through machine learning methods, this paper extends a bypass detection module to traditional SIEM systems

`Q2` *Is this a new problem?*

`A2`: Yes, this paper claimed that it is the first work to address the evasion attack on SIEM.

`Q5` *What is key to the solution proposed in the paper?*

`A5`: The key to the solution proposed in this article is to extend traditional precise matching with the idea of similarity. The bypass detection module of machine learning increases the fault tolerance of detecting bypasses by detecting similarity with rules.
