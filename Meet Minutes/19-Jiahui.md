## Insights


`Q1`: *What problem does the paper attempt to solve?*

`A1`: This article attempts to use LLM to complete the steps of privilege escalation in attacks. Considering that the industry uses a benchmark to evaluate LLM capabilities without a specific task for evaluating privilege escalation, this article establishes a privilege escalation benchmark and designs a prototype to automatically test it.

`Q2` *Is this a new problem?*

`A2`: Yes, this paper claimed that it is the first work to establishes a privilege escalation benchmark.
